\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Agent coordination in complex scenarios involve the optimized usage of the resources that each agent has to accomplish a global goal. Complex scenarios can be understood as those in which there is a set of agents that must perform multiple tasks in an dynamic environment, where existing tasks can disappear and new tasks can arise. Rescue operations in disaster situations \cite{Kitano2000} and the control of a team of agents in real time strategy games are examples of complex scenarios \cite{Weber+2011}.

In complex scenarios, a natural way to organize the work between agents is to decompose the goal in tasks. Therefore, task allocation becomes an important part of the coordination problem \cite{Ferreira+2008ccmms}. 

In this work we present an approach for task allocation that uses a genetic algorithm to adjust the parameters of Swarm-GAP, a scalable algorithm for task allocation based on swarm intelligence \cite{Ferreira+2008ccmms}. We test this approach in a complex task allocation scenario provided by a real time strategy game, namely, StarCraft: BroodWar\footnote{StarCraft: BroodWar is a trademark of Blizzard Entertainment}. Our fitness function is based in match results, which are computationally expensive to compute. Thus, we employ methods to estimate fitness instead of actually evaluating it, in order to accelerate the execution of the genetic algorithm.

Our results show that ...

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: ...

\section{Preliminary concepts}
\label{sec:concepts}

%In this section we present basic concepts in task allocation and how Swarm GAP works.

\subsection{Task allocation}
\label{sec:ta}

Task allocation is concerned with the assignment of tasks to agents in order to maximize a global metric of performance, usually related to the skills of the agents to perform each task type. In dynamic environments, the task allocation problem can be modeled as an instance of E-GAP (Extended Generalized Assignment Problem) \cite{Scerri+2005}. E-GAP is an generalization of the GAP (Generalized Assignment Problem), which is NP-complete \cite{Shmoys&Tardos1993}. 

The E-GAP can be formalized as follows: let $\taskset$ be the set of tasks and $\agentset$ the set of agents. Each agent $i \in \agentset$ possui $\agtres{i}$ resources to perform tasks. Each task $j \in \taskset$ consumes $\rescspt{i}{j}$ resources of agent $i$, when it performs the task. Each agent $i$ has a capability $\agtcap{i}{j} \in [0:1]$ to perform task $j$. Capability can be regarded as the skill of the agent to perform the task. %A value of $\agtcap{i}{j}$ close to $1$ means that $i$ performs $j$ with high speed or quality.

An allocation matrix $A_{|\agentset| \times |\taskset|}$ has its elements $a_{ij}$ set according to Equation \ref{eq:egap-allocation}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:egap-allocation}
a_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
  1,& \text{if } j \text{ is performed by } i\\
  0,& \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

% A solução ótima é dada pela matriz $A^*$, que maximiza a recompensa do sistema, que considera a aptidão para realização das tarefas pelos agentes. Os limites de recursos dos agentes e a restrição de haver apenas um agente para cada tarefa devem ser respeitados, conforme mostra a Equação \ref{eq:gap-optimal}.
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:gap-optimal}
% \begin{split}
% A^* = arg\max_{A'}\sum_{i \in \agentset}\sum_{j \in \taskset} \agtcap{i}{j} \times a'_{ij}\\
% \text{ sujeito a }\\
% \forall \enspace i \in \agentset, \sum_{j \in \taskset} \rescspt{i}{j} \times a_{ij} \leq \agtres{i}\\
% \text{ e } \\
% \forall \enspace j \in \taskset, \sum_{i \in \agentset} a_{ij} \leq 1
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
In E-GAP, the total reward $W$ is calculated as the sum of the rewards of the agents along $t$ timesteps. In one timestep, the reward is calculated considering the capability of the agents to perform the tasks they were assigned. A delay cost $d_j^t$ is applyed as a penalty for not allocating task $j$ in timestep $t$. The calculation of reward along the timesteps captures the dynamics of the environment. E-GAP also considers task interdependence, but this aspect will not be investigated in this work. 

The goal in E-GAP is to maximize the total reward $W$ given by Eq. \ref{eq:egap-total-reward}. %A Eq. \ref{eq:egap-total-reward} possui semelhança com a Eq. \ref{eq:gap-optimal}, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:egap-total-reward}
\begin{split}
W = \sum_t \sum_{i^t \in \agentset^t} \sum_{j^t \in \taskset^t} k_{ij}^t \times a_{ij}^t - 
\sum_t \sum_{j^t \in \taskset^t}(1 - a_{ij}^t) \times d_j^t\\
\text{ subject to }\\
\forall t \forall i^t \in \agentset^t, \sum_{j^t \in \taskset^t} \rescspt{i}{j}^t \times a_{ij}^t \leq \agtres{i}^t \\
\text{ and }\\
\forall t \forall j^t \in \taskset^t, \sum_{i^t \in \agentset^t} a_{ij}^t \leq 1
\end{split}
\end{equation}

With this model, instead of looking for a single allocation, we seek a sequence of allocations along in each discrete timestep. The allocations are constrained by the limited agent resources and the restriction that only one agent can perform each task.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.

%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
