Implementation of the techniques described in the paper:
`A. R. Tavares, H. Azpurua, and L. Chaimowicz. Evolving Swarm Intelligence for Task Al-
location in a Real Time Strategy Game. In Computer Games and Digital Entertainment
(SBGAMES), 2014 Brazilian Symposium on, pages 99–108, November 2014` (Best paper in SBGames 2014 Computing Track) - http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SBGAMES.2014.17 - bibtex:

```

Basically, a Task Allocation algorithm based on swarm intelligence was employed to control a StarCraft bot. Then, a Genetic Algorithm was used to tune its parameters.
