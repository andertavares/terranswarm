Implementation of the techniques described in the paper "Evolving swarm intelligence for task allocation in a real time strategy game" - http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SBGAMES.2014.17

Basically, a Task Allocation algorithm based on swarm intelligence was employed to control a StarCraft bot. Then, a Genetic Algorithm was used to tune its parameters.
